Great! Let's go through Assignment 4 step-by-step. This assignment focuses on another fundamental NLP task: Lemmatization using WordNet, an English lexical database.

We’ll cover:

What the code does

How each part works

What lemmatization is and why it's important

The difference between stemming and lemmatization

And how all this fits into the NLP pipeline

🧠 What Is Lemmatization?
Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base or dictionary form (called the lemma).

📌 Example:

"running" → "run" (verb)

"better" → "good" (adjective)

Unlike stemming, which simply chops off suffixes, lemmatization is smarter — it uses a dictionary and considers Part-of-Speech (POS) to return real words.

✅ What This Program Does:
This code creates a simple menu-based tool that:

Accepts a word from the user.

Lemmatizes it using:

No POS tag

POS tag as adjective

POS tag as verb

Keeps running until the user exits.

📘 Step-by-Step Code Explanation
🔌 Importing and Downloading Resources
python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk: Natural Language Toolkit.

wordnet: A large lexical database for English, used for lemmatization.

🔍 WordNet groups English words into sets of synonyms and provides:

Definitions

POS tags

Relationships like synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms

🧰 Import and Initialize the Lemmatizer
python
Copy code
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
Initializes the WordNet Lemmatizer.

It's more accurate when you provide a POS tag (like noun, verb, adjective).

🔁 Lemmatization Function
python
Copy code
def lemmatize_word(word, pos=None):
    if pos:
        return lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos=pos)
    else:
        return lemmatizer.lemmatize(word)
Takes a word and optional POS tag.

Uses the lemmatize() method.

If no POS tag is given, it defaults to noun.

⚠️ Note: Lemmatizer assumes noun if no POS is provided, which might give incorrect results for verbs or adjectives.

📋 Menu-Driven Main Function
python
Copy code
def main():
    while True:
        ...
This part builds a looping menu that lets the user choose between:

Choice	Action
1	Lemmatize without POS
2	Lemmatize as adjective (pos='a')
3	Lemmatize as verb (pos='v')
4	Exit the program
Each choice takes user input and prints the lemmatized version.

🚀 Example Interaction
pgsql
Copy code
--- Lemmatizer Menu ---
1. Lemmatize a word without POS tag
2. Lemmatize a word with POS tag (adjective)
3. Lemmatize a word with POS tag (verb)
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4): 3
Enter the word to lemmatize: running
Lemmatized word (as verb): run
🧠 Without the POS tag: "running" → "running"
🧠 With the correct POS ('v'): "running" → "run"

💡 POS Tag Shortcuts for Lemmatizer
POS Tag	Meaning	Used as
'n'	Noun	pos='n'
'v'	Verb	pos='v'
'a'	Adjective	pos='a'
'r'	Adverb	pos='r'
Note: lemmatize(word, pos='v') means "lemmatize this word assuming it's a verb".

🔄 Lemmatization vs. Stemming
Feature	Lemmatization	Stemming
Uses dictionary?	✅ Yes (WordNet)	❌ No
Grammar-aware?	✅ Yes (needs POS)	❌ No
Output real word?	✅ Yes	❌ Often not
Examples	“better” → “good”	“running” → “run”
🧠 Why Use Lemmatization in NLP?
Lemmatization is used in many NLP tasks like:

✅ Search engines (better match for queries)

✅ Text classification

✅ Chatbots

✅ Sentiment analysis

✅ Machine translation

✅ Document clustering

Example:

"I am running"

"He runs fast"
Lemmatization normalizes both “running” and “runs” to “run” → helps machine recognize they're the same base concept.
